I did this in eclipse, and I strongly recommend that's what is used for running this to test it yourself.
I ran into a lot of issues downloading it from myself and opening it in a different workspace, so I 
will be explaining all of the set up process here.
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Eclipse Set-Up
1. When launching eclipse and it asks for a workspace, choose 'Use This As Workspace' as the workspace
2a. To avoid any compatability issues, I put an exact copy of the javafx sdk I used
2b. When it launches, right click 'keystone' in package explorer go to Java Application>Main>Arguments 
   and add the VM argument: --module-path "path\to\javafx\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
3. Under the same tab, go to Dependencies, click 'Modulepath Entries' and click 'Add External JARS' to the right
4. Add the mysql-connector that is included in the zip file, as well as all jar files in javaFX/lib
5. You should be able to run the program now.

SQL Setup
This should be easier. I included the .sql file in the zipfile. 
If using XAMPP, you should be able to import the database by clicking import and selecting the database file,
From there, you can sign in to the program using user: admin and pass: admin.
